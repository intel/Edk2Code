# Introduction

## Overview of EDK2Code
The EDK2Code Extension for Visual Studio Code is designed to enhance the development experience for engineers working with the EDK2 (UEFI) codebase. By providing advanced features such as syntax highlighting, code navigation, and error detection, the extension integrates these capabilities directly into Visual Studio Code. This allows developers to streamline their workflow and increase productivity.

EDK2Code makes it easier for developers to navigate through the code, quickly identify errors, and benefit from improved readability of EDK2 source files. This results in a more efficient development process and a smoother coding experience.

## Key Features
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Provides syntax highlighting for various EDK2 file types (INF, DSC, DEC, VFR, ACPI).
- **Code Navigation**: Features like "Go to Definition," "Show Call Hierarchy," and "Go to INF" enhance code navigation.
- **Error Detection**: Detects and highlights errors in the code, improving code quality.
- **Workspace Configuration**: Automatically configures workspace settings based on indexed source code.
- **Indexing Source Code**: Allows indexing of source code to enable advanced features like auto-completion and definition lookup.
- **Command Palette Integration**: Provides EDK2-specific commands accessible via the command palette.
- **Cscope Integration**: Uses Cscope for better C definitions and navigation.
